#  Query Optimization Report

##  Objective  
This report outlines the process of **refactoring complex queries** to improve performance in an Airbnb-Clone database.  
The goal is to reduce execution time, minimize unnecessary joins, and leverage indexing effectively.


##  Initial Query  
The first query retrieves **bookings, user details, property details, and payment records**:  

```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status,
    u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location,
    pay.payment_id, pay.amount, pay.payment_date
FROM Booking AS b
JOIN User AS u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property AS p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN Payment AS pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Get a complete view of booking transactions. 
‚ùå **Potential Issues**: May cause **full table scans** and **slow execution time** due to multiple joins.

## Step 1: Performance Analysis
Before optimizing, run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify inefficiencies:

```sql 
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status,
    u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location,
    pay.payment_id, pay.amount, pay.payment_date
FROM Booking AS b
JOIN User AS u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property AS p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN Payment AS pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

Key Observations
- **High row scans** ‚Üí Query is scanning **entire tables**, causing slow performance.

- **Missing indexes on frequently used columns** ‚Üí `user_id`, `property_id`, and `start_date` lack indexing.

- **JOIN complexity** ‚Üí INNER JOIN removes unmatched data, which may be unnecessary.

## Step 2: Refactored Query (Optimized for Speed)
The improved query: 
```sql 
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status,
    u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location,
    pay.payment_id, pay.amount, pay.payment_date
FROM Booking AS b
LEFT JOIN User AS u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN Property AS p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment AS pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.start_date >= '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY b.start_date ASC;
```

‚úÖ Improvements Made

 üîπ **Replaced INNER JOIN with LEFT JOIN** ‚Üí Allows bookings without payments or properties to be included.

 üîπ **Added WHERE filter** (`b.start_date >= '2025-01-01'`) ‚Üí Reduces search range, improving efficiency.

 üîπ **Introduced indexing** (see below) to enhance query speed.

## Step 3: Indexing for Performance Boost
Save indexing commands in database_index.sql:
```sql 
-- Optimize JOIN operations
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON Booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON Booking(property_id);

-- Optimize filtering & sorting
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON Booking(start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON User(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location ON Property(location);
```
‚úÖ Why Indexing Helps?

- **Speeds up filtering** (`WHERE start_date >= '2025-01-01'`).

- **Optimizes joins** (`Booking.user_id, Property.property_id`).

- **Reduces unnecessary row scans for better execution time**.

## Step 4: Post-Optimization Performance Testing
Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` again to compare results:

```sql 
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status,
    u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location,
    pay.payment_id, pay.amount, pay.payment_date
FROM Booking AS b
LEFT JOIN User AS u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN Property AS p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment AS pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.start_date >= '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY b.start_date ASC;
```

**Expected improvements after indexing**:

- **Reduced row scans** ‚Üí Queries execute faster.

- **Indexes utilized** ‚Üí MySQL avoids full table scans, improving efficiency.

- **JOIN performance optimized** ‚Üí Better handling of related records.

 ## Conclusion
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initial Query** ‚Üí Complex joins & full table scans resulted in slow execution.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Performance Analysis** ‚Üí Identified indexing needs & filtering inefficiencies.
